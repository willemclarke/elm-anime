## elm-manga
- Personal project to learn a bit more about elm (which I have really enjoyed thus far), with one of my interests, manga, as the focal point.
- Uses the [AniList API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/overview/graphql)
  - [elm-graphql](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql) library to consume the data.
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for styling
